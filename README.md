### 👋 Hi there

My name is **Oliwier**, but most people call me Oli or by my online username "Qyful"! I am a full-stack web development and software engineering contractor based in the United Kingdom with over eight (8) years of experience in the field. I am also in full-time education!

### 🤔 Why "Qyful"?

The name stems from an inside joke in my old friend group where I would continously be frustrated at a video game's in-game queue being full ("queue why full"). This later turned into Qyful when I decided I needed a new username. 

### ⚡ What technologies do you work with?

Currently, I work with numerous different programming languages such as C# and Python. I also work extensively with HTML, SCSS/CSS, JavaScript (including VueJS).

### 🌱 What are you currently learning?

At the moment, I am learning ReactJS and Svelte.

### 📫 How can I reach you?

The best place to reach me is to send me a message on Discord at `Qyful#1800` or `@Qyful` on all socials!
